# SimPoll Module
## description
SimPoll is a module for Joomla that allows admins to create a poll and display it on the front end. 

## Requirements
SimPoll Module is fairly simple and will (hopefully) play nice with:
- [x] Joomla 4.X
- [x] Joomla 5.X
- [x] PHP 8.0+

## Installation
+ Download the SimPoll Module from here.
+ Navigate to the Joomla administrator panel.
+ Go to System -> Install -> Extensions.
+ Upload and install the module package.
+ Find the "SimPoll Module", open it, fill in a question and the respective answers, set a module position for it and enable it.

## Usage
Current settings include: 
+ **Poll Question:** The question of the poll
+ **Poll Answers:** The poll's possible answers for the visitors to choose. Your poll can have as many as 7 answers. 
+  **Custom CSS:** A field where you can customize the appearance of the Module, by filling in the corresponding CSS classes. Some classes are preset based on the Cassiopeia template (which is the default joomla template), you can alter them according to your needs.
+  Module Class Suffix: Of course you can also set a Module Class Suffix in the "Advanced" tab for individual CSS styling.
